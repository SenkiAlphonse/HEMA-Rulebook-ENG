# FEBUS tournament rulebook
## 1. GOALS

The primary motivation for the tournament organization is a practical test of fencing skills in a controlled, athletic-driven environment. The objective of these rules is to limit a fencing match in such a way that fine techniques, functional strategy, tactics and athletic skills would be required to win a duel. Furthermore, they are an essential safety measure.

One of the principles which stand above all others is the principle of fair play. Every functional ruleset should be efficient in providing equal opportunities for every tournament contestant.

It is also presumed that the rules will be modified from time to time, both to help to elevate the quality of fencing and also prevent their gamification in a way which is unrelated to the original art of fencing. In spite of this ambition, this kind of will always be considered a combat sport and not a real fight, so each fight will be judged only within the framework of these rules (fencing psychology, value, and validity of hits and targets, etc.).


## 2. BASIC TERMS

- *Bout* – a friendly fight between two fencers which is commenced and ended up by a qualified referee. An exchange may end up by awarding a fencer with a point, or awarding both contestants by a tie, awarding no one.
- *Exchange* – an exchange or handwork is the basic unit of a fight. An exchange starts with the first offensive action and ends up with a hit or with both contestants assuming a distance from which it is impossible to continue in the previous offensive action.
- *Match* – a match is a series of exchanges between two contestants where points awarded for the individual exchanges determine the outcome of a match. Only one fencer is declared a winner of a match.
- *Tournament* – is a series of multiple matches with the aim to declare an overall winner from the contestants.
- *Tempo* – is the basic unit in which a simple fencing action can be done.
- *In measure* – is a mutual distance between two fencers in which one or both of them can reach the opponent in the attack.
- *Bind* – contact of blades.

## 3. FENCING ACTIONS
This section of the rules defines basic fencing actions in terms which are easy to understand for every contestant even though they might practice different schools of fencing and thus use various terminologies.

### 3.1.	OFFENSIVE ACTIONS
* *Attack* – an attack is the initial offensive action which drives every exchange.
* *Simple attack* – is an attack which is aimed at one target from its initial movement. It starts with the movement of the weapon and the body towards the opponent with the arms extending from the initial guard or posture. The preparation of the attack nor the backswing is not considered as a part of the attack.
* *Direct attack* – is a simple attack aimed and done against a target, done without any feinting, from an initial position and in the direction of the preparation.
    * *Indirect attack* – is a simple attack done without feinting; its trajectory ends in a different line than that of the preparation.
    * *Complex attack* – is an attack which consists of one or more feints; its purpose is to lure the opponent into a defensive action and at the same time hit him to the created (or different) opening.
* *Riposte* – a riposte is an offensive action of a fencer who parried an attack of their opponent, executed in a single tempo or in two tempi.
* *Counter-riposte* – is an offensive action of a fencer who paries their opponent’s riposte.
* *Counter-attack* – is an offensive or offensive-defensive action of a fencer done within an attack of their opponent.
* *Stop-hit* – an attack into the opponent’s attack.
* *Stop-hit* with opposition – an attack into the opponent’s attack with a concurrent blocking of the potential target.
* *Feint* – a false attack with the purpose of provoking a reaction from the opponent.
* *Doubling* – a subsequent, continuing action against a parrying opponent who isn’t countering with a Riposta.
