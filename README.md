# FEBUS tournament rulebook

> Regulations for categories: Longsword, Rapier and Dagger
---

## Introduction

The goal of this event is to assess fencing in a safe and friendly manner on the principle of 'to touch without being touched'. In common with historical rule-sets, competitions are explicitly an abstracted test of skill, and not a simulation of an unregulated combat “to the finish” – in this sense, we shall regard each individual point as a separate "duel" within the framework of the following rules, the loss of which is indicated by having a point called against the losing fencer. Our intention is to determine the relative ranking, and the best fencer among the competitors present on the days of the competitions,  in terms of tactical, technical, and athletic skills.

One of the principles which stand above all others is the principle of fair play. Every functional ruleset should be efficient in providing equal opportunities for every tournament contestant.

## Athletes, weapons, equipment 

1. The competition is open to athletes of 18 years and older.
2. It is prohibited to enter a competition under influence of alcohols or drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians).
1. Requirements for safety equipment and weapons are specified in the Equipment Standards.


## Organisational Rules

### The Process of the Bouts

1. The competitors present themselves in the arena when called by the referee before each pool or direct elimination bout, in appropriate gear conforming to the rules and be ready to fence.

2. An additional equipment check  will be performed by the referee directly before each round to confirm completeness of safety gear and weapons. The Referee has the right to repeat this check any time he/she finds it necessary. Fencers who appear in the arena wearing or using unapproved or incomplete equipment will be penalised according to the Rulebook's regulations, and will not be allowed to start or continue competing without having the item(s) approved or replaced with approved ones. (see Equipment Standards).
 
3. Each fencer is allowed one coach/second who is allowed to be near the arena during bouts. This person may speak to their fencer during breaks but may not disturb the bout with verbal or physical gestures. Generally, it is the fencer who should address the referee for help, clarification or appeals, the seconds should not interfere with the bout in any other way than advising their fencers during breaks. 

4. The competitors called first place themselves to the right of the referee behind the on guard line.
Pool bouts last 3 minutes of effective fencing time; or until one of the fencers reaches 5 points. Direct Elimination bouts last 2 * 3 minutes of effective fencing time, with one minute resting period after two and four minutes; or until one of the fencers reaches 7 points. 

5. The 'End of Time' is going to be announced by a Timekeeper, but the match can be stopped only by the referee.

6. Before the beginning of each bout, the two fencers called on the arena salute to their opponent, and the referee. Competitors come on guard when the referee gives the order ‘On guard!’, after which the referee asks, ‘Are you ready?’. On the affirmative, or in the absence of a negative reply, the command will be given for fencing to commence with the word ‘Fence!’. 

7. The assault stops when the referee commands ‘Halt!/Stop!’ and there are several reasons for stopping a bout:
  - valid hit
  - invalid hit which may complicate the exchange evaluation
  - leaving the arena with both feet
  - run out of the time
  - dangerous or unclear or chaotic situation 
  - fencers request
 
8. Fencers may ask for a break by signaling with their arm raised. This may be done due to any reason that proves to be valid (e.g. equipment failure, injury). However, the assault stops only when the Referee gives the command to stop.

9. No actions that have started before the command to start or after the command to stop may be counted as valid. Starting any action before the command to start and initiating an action after the command to stop belong to the first group of offences. 

10. When a competitor crosses one of the boundaries of the arena with both feet completely off the arena, the Referee must immediately stop the bout.

11. If the fencer goes off the arena with both feet, the Referee must annul everything that has occurred after the boundary has been crossed.

13. A hit scored by the fencer who leaves the arena with one foot only is valid provided that the action was started before the bout was stopped.
 
14. Should a competitor cross the boundary of the arena completely — i.e. with both feet — he/she will be penalised with a yellow card first, and in each subsequent cases, a red card.

15. However, if a fencer leaves the boundaries of the arena due to jostling (opponent pushes him out of the arena), no penalty will be applied.

16. After each valid hit and in case the bout is stopped for other reasons (confused fencing, malfunction, unsuccessful grappling, etc.) the bout continues from the 'On guard' position, at the starting line. 

17. When available, fencers have the right to appeal for video review once during bout. If the video review alters the referee's verdict in their favour, they retain the right to appeal for video review during that bout. 
 
18. In case the points of the fencers are equal at the time limit, an additional minute of time is given, during which the first valid hit wins the bout. Additionally, before overtime starts, the referee flips a coin and randomly assigns one of the two fencers with priority. If the sudden death overtime runs out with neither fencer scoring, the fencer with priority wins the bout. This randomly assigned priority has no effect on the judgment of actions during the overtime.

19. At the end of the bout the referee will announce the winner and the final score. The opponents shall salute to the referees and the opponent and shake hands with the opponent (3rd group). 

20. After the pool round and each direct elimination bout, the fencers shall check and sign the result sheet filled in by the referee during the bout, before leaving the arena. 

21. For an equipment failure which occurs in the course of a bout, the referee may allow a break in the fight lasting up to 3 minutes (measured from the point when the failure has been acknowledged by the referee). This time interval can be used to mend or replace, and check the equipment in question. If a fencer is not able to continue fencing before or at the end of the break, the referee has the authority to disqualify the fencer from that bout. 

22. For an injury or cramp which occurs in the course of a bout the referee may allow a break in the fight lasting up to 10 minutes (measured from the point when the qualified staff give their opinion). This time interval is reserved for the treatment of the injury or cramp which brought it about. No further interruption can be allowed in the same bout for the same injury. If the professional attendant deems the fencer unsafe/incapable to fence before or at the end of the 10-minute break, they have the authority to withdraw the fencer from the bout, or the competition.

23. In case the fencer forfeits one bout due to an equipment malfunction or injury, during the pool phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, but the score is not annulled (it is possible to win a bout while having less points than the opponent, in this case). In the direct elimination phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, and the fencer does not lose their place in the overall classification of the competition. 

24. Only one bout can be forfeited in the pool, should the fencer be unable to fence through a bout a second time, they must withdraw from the competition. (They may still participate in other competitions/weapons in the tournament)

25. In case the fencer is withdrawn from the competition during the pool bouts, their results shall be scratched, and their opponents shall be declared as winning V0-D0 in each of their past or future pool bouts, regardless of the previously achieved results. The withdrawn fencer does not participate in the calculation of ranking for the direct elimination table.

26. If the fencer withdraws from the competition during the last pool bout, the score shall be recorded as if they had forfeited only one pool bout (see previous paragraph), but they will not be included at the calculation if ranking for the direct elimination table.

27. If the fencer withdraws during the direct elimination phase, the opponent is declared as winning, and the fencer does not lose their place in the overall classification of the competition.


## The Refereeing system 

### Main referee

1. The referee works with an assistant (side referee) and manages the time and protocol (when necessary, supported by an administrative crew). 

2. The referee gives the signals to start, stop, assigns points and describes what happened during the entire assault or at least the last exchange. 

3. After stopping the bout, the referee consults with the assistant and proposes a result. If the fencers accept the decision (they say nothing), the fight continues with the proposed score. If they don’t agree with the referee, but they agree with each other, the referee may make a decision according to their wishes. If any of the fencers protests and the fencers disagree with each other, the referee will decide whether to assign a point (being completely sure) or repeat the assault. 

4. If the referee is unable to interpret the fencing phrase for some reason, he/she can repeat the exchange but will explain and apologise. 

5. Referees' decisions can not be contested after the bout. 

### Side referee
1.	An assistant referee helps the main referee in scoring and hit evaluation. His task is to observe a match from a different angle than the main referee.

2.	If an assistant observes that a fencer they are to follow received a hit, they should raise their arm. The main referee then may or may not stop the fighting.

3. An assistant referee is not responsible for point assignment nor for the overall match score. 


## The Principles of Scoring 

### General rules 

1. Each bout is performed for a set amount of time or until a set amount of hits This is achieved through a series of separate, independent assaults.

2. Fencing time is the time required to perform one simple fencing action. In judging hits, referees will count immediate actions that start up to the moment of the first hit, as relevant actions. 

3. When only one of the fencers receives a hit within one period of fencing time, the fencer who was hit is called one point against. 

4. In case both fencers hit within one period of fencing time, three different tactical situations are defined in the rules. 

5. A simultaneous hit is the result of a similar conception and execution of both fencers at the same time. In these cases, both fencers are called a point against.

6. A double hit occurs when both fencers get hit within a period of fencing time, but are not simultaneous actions, are evaluated according to the rules or each specific weapon.

7. An after-action is a double hit situation, where the fencer at fault starts a counter action (or the finishing move of a compound action) at or after the moment of receiving a hit. After-actions do not score, and do not nullify the hit received.

8. Hits can be achieved by following offensive actions:
   1.	Cut - using the edge or the flat of the blade towards the whole valid area. A cut must be performed with a visually distinctive trajectory (preparation more than 45 degrees) and must correspond with an action that would probably cause the target area to be wounded, e.g. hitting head with the flat surface of the sword also counts 
    2.	Thrust - using the point of the blade towards the whole valid area. A valid thrust must be performed in such a way that it would be visually distinctive, e.g. the blade will be bent at the end of the action and the point will traverse approx. at least 20cm. 
    3.	Slice - using the edge of the sword against the whole valid area. A slice must be a movement which is defined by pushing or pulling of the blade against the valid area in a visually distinctive way. 
    4.	Strike - using the pommel of the weapon against the opponent’s uncovered part of mask. 
    
9. The referee may call an action as a valid hit, when a weapon action results in a passively constraining position for the opponent, for a considerable time during which the opponent is unable to break free. This may be the result of of grappling, locks involving the weapon, or opposing actions that restrain the opponent’s weapon movement for a considerable time, until the referee finds all criteria of dominance met, and calls “Halt!”. Hits received while this dominant position is upheld are not considered valid. However, dominance can not be applied to situations, when the opponent can practically break free and initiate valid actions, even if by some active measures, the weapon contact is not completely broken. It is up to the referee’s discretion to judge the validity of dominance actions.

10. Against thrusts, and cuts with the edge, the flat, or the back edge of the blade, the object of the parry is to prevent hits made by the opponent arriving on the valid target; therefore: 
    1. The parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish. 
    2. When a parry is properly executed, the attack by the opponent must be declared parried, and judged as such by the Referee, even if, as a result of its flexibility, the tip of the opponent’s weapon makes contact with the target. 
    
11. Unintentional invalid hit can annul subsequent valid hits upon referees discretion. 

## Close quarter combat

Close quarter combat and grappling are allowed with the following regulations: 

2. The Referee may call 'Halt!' after an unsuccessful period of grappling. 
3. Grappling on the opponent's blade is allowed, if the blade is controlled. Seizing of the blade needs to be momentary, and followed by an immediate 'clean' hit to score a point. If the competitor can not achieve a hit consequently to seizing the blade, the Referee will call 'Halt!' and award no points. Failing to control the blade will be counted as a point against the competitor who attempted to enter grappling. 

4. Disarming is allowed and scores a point, unless the disarmed fencer immediately (before the referee calls 'Halt!') controls the opponent's weapon and enters grappling. 

5. If a fencer accidentally drops the weapon, or falls without the opponent's interaction, the Referee shall call 'Halt!'. A hit that started before the fencer obviously lost the weapon should be counted as valid even if it arrives afterwards, but in the spirit of sportsmanship, no intentional new attack should be initiated if the opponent has fallen or lost the weapon. 

6. Grappling actions that score a point are: 
    1. take-downs and throws followed/accompanied by a simple and immediate hit with the weapon (within a period of fencing time), 
    2. controlling the opponent via grappling with or without the weapon, or until the Referee calls 'Halt!'. 
    
7. Ground action is not allowed, the Referee shall call “Halt!” when one of the fencers falls to the ground, or whenever the referee is unable to judge the action any more, or when a reasonable time has passed for dominance to apply.


### Forbidden actions 

1. Neck-wrenching, lifting the opponent off the ground, full application of joint locks, small-joint manipulation, or other potentially dangerous wrestling techniques, punching, kicking, violent jostling, and throwing the weapon are strictly forbidden.

2. Excessive force, brutality or unnecessary violence are forbidden. 
 Hitting the back of the head the spine, the back of the knee or the foot is forbidden.
 
3. Turning the head or covering a valid target with a non-valid one belongs to the first group of offences.
 
4. Uncontrolled attacks without touching opponents body or weapon which hits the arena floor are evaluated as first group of offences.

5. It is forbidden to hit with the cross-guard; and in all circumstances, to hit the back of the head, spine and back of the knee, and the foot of the opponent and will be penalised.
