# FEBUS tournament rulebook


## Introduction

The goal of this event is to assess fencing in a safe and friendly manner on the principle of 'to touch without being touched'. In common with historical rule-sets, competitions are explicitly an abstracted test of skill, and not a simulation of an unregulated combat “to the finish” – in this sense, we shall regard each individual point as a separate "duel" within the framework of the following rules, the loss of which is indicated by having a point called against the losing fencer. Our intention is to determine the relative ranking, and the best fencer among the competitors present on the days of the competitions,  in terms of tactical, technical, and athletic skills.

One of the principles which stand above all others is the principle of fair play. Every functional ruleset should be efficient in providing equal opportunities for every tournament contestant.
