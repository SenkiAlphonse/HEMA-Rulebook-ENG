## Fencing actions

This section of the rules defines basic fencing actions in terms which are easy to understand for every contestant even though they might practice different schools of fencing and thus use various terminologies.

### Offensive actions

- *Attack* – an attack is the initial offensive action which drives every exchange.
- *Simple attack* – is an attack which is aimed at one target from its initial movement. It starts with the movement of the weapon and the body towards the opponent with the arms extending from the initial guard or posture. The preparation of the attack nor the backswing is not considered as a part of the attack.
- *Direct attack* – is a simple attack aimed and done against a target, done without any feinting, from an initial position and in the direction of the preparation.
  - *Indirect attack* – is a simple attack done without feinting; its trajectory ends in a different line than that of the preparation.
  - *Compound attack* – is an attack which consists of one or more feints; its purpose is to lure the opponent into a defensive action and at the same time hit him to the created (or different) opening.
- *Riposte* – a riposte is an offensive action of a fencer who parried an attack of their opponent, executed in a single tempo or two tempi.

- *Counter-riposte* – is an offensive action of a fencer who parries their opponent’s riposte.
- *Counter-attack* – is an offensive or offensive-defensive action of a fencer done within an attack of their opponent.
- *Stop-hit* – an attack into the opponent’s attack.
- *Stop-hit* with opposition – an attack into the opponent’s attack with a concurrent blocking of the potential target.
- *Feint* – a false attack to provoke a reacting parry from the opponent.
- *Renewed attack* – a subsequent, continuing offensive action after the initial attack.

### Defensive actions

- *Parry* – a defensive action which blocks the opponent’s weapon from reaching its target. 
- *Evasion* – it is an action of the body when a potential target avoids being hit by prolonging the distance or by another movement.
