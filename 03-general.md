### General rules

## The Process of the Bouts

1.  Each bout is performed for a set amount of time or until a set amount of hits. This is achieved
    through a series of separate, independent assaults.

1.  The competitors present themselves in the arena when called by the referee before each pool or
    direct elimination bout, in appropriate gear conforming to the rules and be ready to fence.

1.  Before each round, the referee will perform an additional brief check on the fencers assigned to the arena, to
    confirm that the equipment is complete and bears the regulation markings of standards and weapon-check.
    The Referee has the right to repeat this check any time they find it necessary.
    Fencers who appear in the arena wearing or using unapproved or incomplete equipment will be penalised according to the Rulebook's regulations, and will not be allowed to start or continue competing without having the item(s) approved or replaced with approved ones (see the Equipment Standards).

1.  Each fencer  / team is allowed one coach/second who is allowed to be near the arena during bouts. This
    person may speak to their fencer during breaks but may not disturb the bout with verbal or
    physical gestures. Generally, it is the fencer who should address the referee for help,
    clarification or appeals, the seconds should not interfere with the bout in any other way than
    advising their fencers during breaks.

1.  The competitors called first place themselves to the right of the referee behind the on guard
    line.

1.  Before the bout starts, the referee asks the opponents to agree on the use of wrestling actions during body-to-body combat during their match.

1.  The timekeeper (staff) signals to the referee that time has elapsed, but only the referee can stop the bout.

1.  Before the beginning of each bout, the two fencers called on the arena salute to their opponent,
    and the referee. Competitors come on guard when the referee gives the order ‘On guard!’, after
    which the referee asks, ‘Are you ready?’. On the affirmative, or in the absence of a negative
    reply, the command will be given for fencing to commence with the word ‘Fence!’.

1.  The assault stops when the Referee commands ‘Halt!/Stop!’. The most common reasons for stopping
    a bout:
   1. a valid hit has been made
   1. an invalid hit has been made, which may complicate the evaluation of any further actions
   1. a fencer has left the arena with both feet
   1. end of time
   1. dangerous or confused fencing
   1. equipment failure
   1. injury
   1. a fencer has requested to break the assault

1.  Fencers may ask for a break by signaling with their arm raised. This may be done due to any
    reason that proves to be valid (e.g. equipment failure, injury). However, the assault stops only
    when the Referee gives the command to stop.

1. No actions that have started before the command to start or after the command to stop may be
    counted as valid. Starting any action before the command to start and initiating an action after
    the command to stop belong to the first group of offences.

1. Invalid hits may be disregarded at the Referee's discretion as if never happened, when the
    Referee is able to clearly follow the assault.

1. However, if when the Referee stops the bout, a hit that the referee believed invalid and ignored
    before the conclusion of the last assault proves to have been valid, the Referee shall, if
    possible, make a decision in relation to the actual first hit, even if this results in the
    annulment of other valid hits that happened afterwards.

1. When a competitor crosses one of the boundaries of the arena with both feet completely off the
    arena, the Referee must immediately stop the assault.

1. If the fencer goes off the arena with both feet, the Referee must annul everything that has
    occurred after the boundary has been crossed.

1. A hit scored by the fencer who leaves the arena with one foot only is valid provided that the
    action was started before the bout was stopped, even if the fencer leaves the arena afterwards.

1. Should a competitor cross the boundary of the arena completely — i.e. with both feet — without
    having scored any valid hits before crossing the limit of the arena
   1. upon the first occasion within a bout, the fencer receives a verbal warning
   1. upon each subsequent cases within the bout, a hit will be scored against him (as if they had
       been hit).

1. A competitor who involuntarily crosses one of the boundaries of the arena as the result of any
    accidental cause (such as jostling/being pushed out by the opponent) incurs no penalty.

1. After each valid hit and in case the bout is stopped for other reasons (confused fencing,
    malfunction, unsuccessful grappling, etc.) the bout continues from the 'On guard' position, at
    the starting line.

1. Appeals for Video Refereeing (when available) 
   1. Both in team and individual events, only the fencer in the arena has the right to request a video review. 
   1. In individual events, the fencer has one possible appeal during each bout, both in pool and elimination bouts. Should the referee agree with the fencer who appealed for the video-refereeing, the latter is entitled to retain the right of appeal. The organizer must ensure the technical conditions of the video review in direct elimination bouts.
   1. In team events, the fencers have one possible right to appeal to the video-refereeing per relay and they are entitled to retain this right should the referee agree with the appeal.
   1. In the case of an appeal for video-refereeing, the referee will walk over to the video consultant, they will watch the video together and after having analysed the action, the referee will give their final decision. 

1. In case the points of the fencers are equal at the time limit, an additional minute of time is
    given, during which the first valid hit wins the bout. Additionally, before overtime starts, the
    referee flips a coin and randomly assigns one of the two fencers with priority. If the sudden
    death overtime runs out with neither fencer scoring, the fencer with priority wins the bout.
    This randomly assigned priority has no effect on the judgment of actions during the overtime.
    For the course of the team bouts, see the paragraph '03-general'/'Team bouts'.

1. At the end of the bout the referee will announce the winner and the final score. The opponents
    shall salute to the referees and the opponent and shake hands with the opponent (Refusal to
    observe this rule by one or both of the opponents belongs to the third group of offences).

1. After the pool round and each direct elimination bout, the fencers shall check and sign the
    result sheet filled in by the referee during the bout, before leaving the arena. After team bouts, this is done by the team captains.
    
1. For an equipment failure which occurs in the course of a bout, the referee may allow a break in
    the fight lasting up to 3 minutes (measured from the point when the failure has been
    acknowledged by the referee). This time interval can be used to mend or replace, and check the
    equipment in question. If a fencer is not able to continue fencing before or at the end of the
    break, the referee has the authority to disqualify the fencer from that bout. See 06-organisational/Team_bouts/3/6

1. For an injury or cramp which occurs in the course of a bout the referee may allow a break in the
    fight lasting up to 10 minutes (measured from the point when the qualified staff give their
    opinion). This time interval is reserved for the treatment of the injury or cramp which brought
    it about. No further interruption can be allowed in the same bout for the same injury. If the
    professional attendant deems the fencer unsafe/incapable to fence before or at the end of the
    10-minute break, they have the authority to withdraw the fencer from the bout, or the
    competition.

## Pool bouts

1.  Individual pool bouts last for 3 minutes of actual fencing time or until one fencer reaches 5 points.

1.  In case the fencer forfeits one bout due to an equipment malfunction or injury, during the pool
    phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, but the score is not annulled (it is
    possible to win a bout while having less points than the opponent, in this case).
    
1.  Only one bout can be forfeited in the pool, should the fencer be unable to fence through a bout
    a second time, they must withdraw from the competition. (They may still participate in other
    competitions/weapons in the tournament)

1. In case the fencer is withdrawn from the competition during the pool bouts, their results shall
    be scratched, and their opponents shall be declared as winning V0-D0 in each of their past or
    future pool bouts, regardless of the previously achieved results. The withdrawn fencer does not
    participate in the calculation of ranking for the direct elimination table.

1. If the fencer withdraws from the competition during the last pool bout, the score shall be
    recorded as if they had forfeited only one pool bout (see previous paragraph), but they will not
    be included in the calculation if ranking for the direct elimination table.

1. If the fencer withdraws during the direct elimination phase, the opponent is declared as
    winning, and the fencer does not lose their place in the overall classification of the
    competition.

## Individual Direct Elimination (DE) Bouts

1. Individual DE matches will last 2 * 3 minutes or until one fencer reaches 15 points.
1. 1 minute rest is provided after the first 3 minutes or after one of the fencers has scored 8 points - whichever comes first.
1. If a fencer withdraws in the direct elimination phase, the other contestant is declared as winning, and the fencer does not lose
    their place in the overall classification of the competition.

## Team matches

1. Each bout of the relay match consists of five hits (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.). Exceptionally, a relay may end with more than 5, 10, 15, etc., if a fencer, while scoring the last valid hit of the relay, scores an additional penalty point: in this case both hits count; the maximum time for each bout is 2 minutes.

1. The first two opponents will fence until one of them has scored five hits within a time limit of 2 minutes. The next two opponents will continue until the score of one of the teams is ten, within a 2-minute time limit, and so on in successive five-hit bouts with aggregated scores.

1. If after 2 minutes of fencing time the score for the bout has not been reached, the next two fencers will pick up the score where it left off and continue fencing as usual to the maximum score for the given bout, with a 2-minute time limit.
(Eg. taking up at 1-4 after the first bout, the second bout's max score is 10, within the given time limit.)

1. The team which first reaches the maximum of 45 hits or which has the most hits after the end of normal playing time wins.

1. If the scores are tied at the end of the normal playing time of the last bout, the fencers of the last bout will continue the bout until one decisive hit, with a time limit of 1 minute. Before the resumption of fencing, the Referee will decide by drawing lots who will be the winner if the score is still tied at the end of the extra time.

1. When the match is interrupted for any reason, the fencers may ask how much time they have left to fence.

1. Any fencer who tries to interrupt the match or to prolong the interruption in an irregular manner will be penalised according to the relevant paragraphs of '07-discipline'/'Penalties' and the 'Appendix'/'03-Penalties'.

1. Team members may decide individually whether or not to wrestle the given opponent.
   
## The methods of scoring hits

1. Fencing time is the time required to perform one simple fencing action. In judging hits, referees
   will count immediate actions that start up to the moment of the first hit, as relevant actions.

1. When only one of the fencers receives a hit within one period of fencing time, the fencer who was
   hit is called one point against.

1. In case both fencers hit within one period of fencing time, three different tactical situations
   are defined in the rules.

   1. A simultaneous hit is the result of a similar conception and execution of both fencers at the
      same time. In these cases, both fencers are called a point against.

   1. A double hit occurs when both fencers get hit within a period of fencing time, but are not
      simultaneous actions, are evaluated according to the rules or each specific weapon.

   1. An after-action is a double hit situation, where the fencer at fault starts a counter action
      (or the finishing move of a compound action) at or after the moment of receiving a hit.
      After-actions do not score, and do not nullify the hit received.

1. Hits can be made using the weapon in the following ways:
   1. Cut - an attack carried out with the edge or the flat of the blade on any valid target, which would probably cause the target area to be wounded.
   1. Thrust - carried out with the point of the weapon on any valid target. A valid thrust must be
      performed in such a way that it would be visually distinctive, e.g. the blade will be bent at
      the end of the action and the point will traverse at least 20cm.
   1. Slice - carried out with the edge of the weapon on any valid target. A slice must be a
      movement which is defined by pushing or pulling of the blade against the valid area in a
      visually distinctive way.
   1. Strike - using the pommel of the weapon against the opponent’s facial part of mask.
   1. The referee may call an action as a valid hit, when a weapon action results in a passively
      constraining position for the opponent, for a considerable time during which the opponent is
      unable to break free. This may be the result of of grappling, locks involving the weapon, or
      opposing actions that restrain the opponent’s weapon movement for a considerable time, until
      the referee finds all criteria of dominance met, and calls “Halt!”. Hits received while this
      dominant position is upheld are not considered valid. However, dominance can not be applied to
      situations, when the opponent can practically break free and initiate valid actions, even if
      by some active measures, the weapon contact is not completely broken. It is up to the
      referee’s discretion to judge the validity of dominance actions.

## Close quarter combat

Close quarter combat and grappling are allowed with the following regulations:
1.  Wrestling within any given bout is only allowed if both parties have agreed to it before the start of the bout. If one of the parties does not agree to wrestle, they don't have to give an explanation.
1.  All close-quarter actions that are not carried out with a weapon (techniques using hands/feet/head/etc., holds, disarmaments, punches) are considered a wrestling action, as well as those that are used to manipulate the opponent's body parts instead of directly hitting them with a weapon.
If an opponent did not agree to wrestle in the match, the initiator of any wrestling action commits an offense belonging to the first group of disciplinary offences.
1. The Referee may call 'Halt!' after an unsuccessful period of grappling.
1. Grappling on the opponent's blade is allowed, if the blade is controlled. Seizing of the blade
   needs to be momentary, and followed by an immediate 'clean' hit to score a point. If the
   competitor can not achieve a hit consequently to seizing the blade, the Referee will call 'Halt!'
   and award no points. Failing to control the blade will be counted as a point against the
   competitor who attempted to enter grappling.
1. Grappling actions that score a point are:
   1. take-downs and throws followed/accompanied by a simple and immediate hit with the weapon
      (within a period of fencing time)
   1. controlling the opponent via grappling with or without the weapon, until the Referee calls
      'Halt!'
1. Ground action is not allowed, the Referee shall call “Halt!” when one of the fencers falls to the
   ground, or whenever the referee is unable to judge the action any more, or when a reasonable time
   has passed for dominance to apply.
1. Disarming is allowed and scores a point, unless the disarmed fencer immediately (before the
   referee calls 'Halt!') controls the opponent's weapon and enters grappling.

1. If a fencer accidentally drops the weapon, or falls without the opponent's interaction, the
   Referee shall call 'Halt!'. A hit that started before the fencer obviously lost the weapon should
   be counted as valid even if it arrives afterwards, but in the spirit of sportsmanship, no
   intentional new attack should be initiated if the opponent has fallen or lost the weapon.

### Forbidden actions

1.  Neck-wrenching, lifting the opponent off the ground, full application of joint locks,
    small-joint manipulation, or other potentially dangerous wrestling techniques, punching,
    kicking, violent jostling, and throwing the weapon are strictly forbidden.

1.  Excessive force, brutality or unnecessary violence are forbidden.

1.  Hitting the back of the head the spine, the back of the knee or the foot is forbidden.

1.  Turning the head or covering a valid target with a non-valid one belongs to the first group of
    offences.

1.  Hitting the arena floor with any weapon due to bad measure in an action will be penalised
    according to the first group of offences (cases resulting from the opponent’s interactions,
    accidental touches, and touching the floor after having hit the opponent, may be disregarded by
    the Referee).

1.  It is forbidden to hit with the cross-guard; and in all circumstances, to hit the back of the
    head, spine and back of the knee, and the foot of the opponent and will be penalised.
