# Organisational Rules

1. The competition is open to athletes of 18 years and older.

2. It is prohibited to enter a competition under the influence of alcohol or performance-altering
   drugs (including recreational drugs and those prescribed by physicians).

## The Refereeing system

### Main Referee

1.  The Referee works with an Assistant (side Referee) and manages the time and protocol (when
    necessary, supported by an administrative crew).

2.  The Referee gives the signals to start, stop, assigns points and describes what happened during
    the entire assault or at least the last exchange.

3.  After stopping the bout, the Referee consults with the Assistant and proposes a result. If the
    fencers accept the decision (they say nothing), the fight continues with the proposed score. If
    they don’t agree with the Referee, but they agree with each other, the Referee may make a
    decision according to their wishes. If any of the fencers protests and the fencers disagree with
    each other, the Referee will decide whether to assign a point (being completely sure) or repeat
    the assault.

4.  If the Referee is unable to interpret the fencing phrase for some reason, they can repeat the
    exchange but will explain and apologise.

5.  The Referee's decisions can not be contested after the bout.

6.  Main referee must be able conduct and manage bouts in English.

### Side Referee (Assistant Referee)

1. An Assistant Referee helps the main Referee in scoring and hit evaluation. Their task is to
   observe a match from a different angle than the main Referee.

2. The Assistant may signal hits made by the fencers to the Referee by raising their arm, even if
   the Referee does not halt the assault immediately.

3. An Assistant Referee is not responsible for point assignment nor for the overall match score.

## Organisation of the competitions and classification

### The round of pools

1.  In all competitions for which the formula includes a round of pools, these pools will consist of
    7 fencers if the number of participants is divisible by 7. Otherwise the pools will be of 7 and
    6 fencers.

2.  In the pools a bout ends when:
    1. One of the fencers has scored 5 hits. In this case the score registered on the score- sheet
       is the final score of the bout (V5 – Dn, where n = the number of hits scored by the losing
       fencer).
    2. Three minutes of effective fencing time have passed. (There is no warning for the last
       minute.)

3.  If when the time limit expires there is a difference of at least one point between the scores of
    the two fencers, the fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared winner. The
    score registered on the score-sheet is the actual score achieved in the bout (VN – Dn, where N =
    the number of hits scored by the winning fencer and n = the number of hits scored by the losing
    fencer).

4.  If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit,
    with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences, the Referee draws lots
    to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute.

5.  In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is always the actual score achieved in the
    bout:
    1. VN–Dn if a deciding hit is scored within the time limit for the bout.
    2. V4–D4 or V3–D3 or V2–D2 or V1–D1 or V0–D0 if the winner is designated by drawing lots.
    3. Vn-DN, VN-Dn or Vn-Dn in case a single bout is forfeited due to injury or equipment
       malfunction but the rest of the bouts have been completed regularly. It is always the fencer
       who did not forfeit the bout who is registered as victorious, even though the scores are not
       annulled.
    4. V0-D0 in case a fencer is withdrawn or removed from the competition, marking the opponent as
       the winner, but not registering any scores, for all of the fencer’s bouts in the pool..

6.  Before the competition starts, the Organising Team will decide on and announce the number of
    fencers who will be eliminated based on the ranking established by the pools (0-40%).

7.  After the pools, a single general ranking will be established of all the fencers who have taken
    part in the pools, taking account, successively, of the indices V/M, HS – HR, HS. (V =
    victories; M = bouts; HS = hits scored; HR = hits received.)

8.  A summary classification table shall then be made in the following way:
    1. The results written up on the summary table will be added up to ascertain the two indices
       required.
    2. The first index, for the initial classification, shall be obtained by dividing the number of
       victories by the number of bouts fought, using the formula V/M.
    3. The fencer with the highest index (maximum 1) will be seeded first.
    4. In cases of equality in this first index, and to separate fencers with equal first indices, a
       second index will be established, using the formula HS – HR, the difference between the total
       number of hits scored and hits received.
    5. In cases of equality of the two indices V/M and HS – HR, the fencer who has scored most hits
       will be seeded highest.
    6. In cases of absolute equality between two or more fencers, their seeding order will be
       decided by drawing lots.

9.  Should there be absolute equality among the last to qualify there will not be a barrage, and the
    fencers with equal indicators will all qualify, even if they are in excess of the number decided
    on.

10. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, His/her results are
    recorded as if all of their opponents had won against the fencer, but no score will be
    registered (V0-D0). The fencer who is withdrawn or excluded during the pool, will not be
    included in the calculation of the ranking for the direct elimination table.

11. When a fencer withdraws from one pool bout only, they are declared as having lost the bout, but
    the score established before is not annulled.

## The direct elimination bouts

1.  The direct elimination table (bout plan) – complete or incomplete – is established taking
    account of the classification table and the special rules for each competition (See Figure 2.)

2.  The organisers of a competition publish the direct elimination bout plan. The direct elimination
    bouts are for 15 hits or end when the two periods of three minutes, have passed.

3.  1 minute rest is provided after the first 3 minutes or after one of the fencers has scored 8 points - whichever comes first.

4.  During the one-minute rest a second/coach, named before the bout, may have access to the fencer.

5.  The bout ends when:
    1. One of the fencers has scored 15 hits; or
    2. 2 * 3 minutes of effective fencing time have passed.

6.  The fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared the winner.

7.  If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit,
    with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots
    to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute. In
    this case the score recorded on the score-sheet is the real score achieved in the bout.

8.  Withdrawal: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence, or cannot complete their bout,
    their opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose their place
    in the overall classification of the competition.

## Team matches
1. Teams consist of three fencers for each weapon, with or without a reserve. A team may only start a match if all members are present.

2. 
    1. The team competition shall be conducted with a direct elimination table.
       
    3. The initial seeding on the DE table shall be determined as follows: 
        1. the average of the current weightedRatings of the team members on HEMARatings (the sum of the relativeRatings divided by the number of team members).
        2. If a fencer has a result in both the 'Mixed/Men' and 'Women' categories, the higher weightedRating will count. 
        3. Team members without a HEMARating will be counted equally with the the lowest weightedRating in the category corresponding to the weapon, halved (using Mixed/Men for mixed teams, regardless of gender).
        4. If two teams have the same index calculated in this way, their order shall be determined by drawing lots.
    
    4. After the first round of direct elimination, the first 16 places are all fought for. From the 17th place downwards, teams shall be ranked according to their original position on the board.

3. The competition will be organised as follows:
    1. The method of changes shall apply to all weapons.
       
    2. The three fencers of the team each face three members of the other team, resulting in 9 bouts in succession.
    
    3. The position of each team on the scoresheet (1-3 / 4-6) of the match shall be determined by drawing lots. The order of the individual fencers will then be decided by the team captains.

    4. The bouts of each team match shall be fought in the following order:
       3–6 2–5 1–5 1–4 2–4 2–6 1–6 3–5 3–4
       
    If this order is intentionally or unintentionally changed, all hits after the change are invalidated and the match continues in the correct order.
          
    5. 
        1. The team captain may request the substitution of a fencer by a reserve named before the start of the whole team match. This substitution may only be made at the end of a bout. However, the replaced fencer may fence once more during the match, but only to replace the fencer who originally replaced them. This second substitution is not allowed if the first substitution was made for the reasons listed in Article 3.6 (a fencer forfeits due to injury) below. No further substitution is allowed after this, even in the event of accident or unavoidable circumstances. Notification of the replacement of a fencer must be made at the latest before the start of the match preceding the next match of the fencer to be replaced and the referee must report it to the opposing team captain.
        2. If an accident occurs in the bout following the request for a substitution, the team captain may cancel the request (the reserve might have to step in for the injured fencer instead). 
        3. If, as a consequence, the opposing team captain has also requested a substitution, the substitution requested may be carried out or cancelled.
    6. 
        1. If a team member is obliged to withdraw during a bout due to an accident duly recognised by the Organising Team's medical representative, the captain of his team may request a reserve to continue the bout at the point where the competitor obliged to withdraw withdrew, even during the ongoing bout.
        2. The same procedure shall apply if a member of the team has to be withdrawn from the match due to equipment failure. Cf. 03-general/The Process of the Bouts/24
        3. However, a competitor so replaced may not resume his place in the team for the same team match. 
    7. 
        1. If both the fencer and the reserve (if any) are forced to withdraw, and therefore the team is incomplete, they forfeit the match and must withdraw from the competition. The team retains its place in the final standings. 
        2. If a fencer is disqualified during a team match, his team forfeits the match and the team is disqualified from the competition without a final ranking. Cf. '07-discipline'/'Penalties'/'Types (groups) of penalties'/3
    10. If a team does not complete an event in which it is participating for any reason, the Organising Team will apply the rules for competitors who do not complete an event in an individual event, treating each team as a whole as if it were a single competitor. See also 'Appendix'/'Table of offences'.
    11. If a team does not show up against another team, the following procedure is followed:
        1. If it has already played against another team, it shall be treated as if it had not completed the tournament in which it is participating (cf. '06-organisation'/'The Direct ELimination'/7;
        2. If the team does not appear in his first match, it shall be treated as if he had not taken part in the competition at all. 
5. For rules on time and score limits for team matches, see '03-General'/'Team matches'.

## Order of bouts

1. In each round of the direct elimination table (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 or 4), the bouts are
   always called in the order of the bout plan, starting at the top and ending at the bottom.

## Classification

1. The general classification is obtained as follows:
   1. First: the winner of the bout for the first place
   2. Second: the loser of the bout for the first place
   3. A bout for third and fourth places will be fought between the two losers of the semi-final
      matches.
   4. The remainder are placed, within each round of the direct elimination, in accordance with
      their classification for the composition of the direct elimination table.

## Tournament Staff

1.  Medical/paramedic staff will assess possible injury/illness of the participants during/after
    bouts and advise on immediate management.

2.  The head of the Organising Team is responsible for the overall smooth running of the tournament.
    The Organising Team is available for questions, complaints, compliments, and suggestions, before
    during and after the event.

3.  The head of the Refereeing Team oversees the allocation and performance of the Referees and
    Assistants. The Refereeing committee can be approached directly by the participants or their
    representatives, if questions regarding the performance of any of the Referees are raised.

4.  The head of Equipment Inspection performs pre-tournament checks of safety equipment and weapons,
    stamps passed items and keeps a list of participants whose safety equipment has been deemed
    satisfactory.

5.  The Technical Team manages the technical infrastructure, including the competition management
    software, ensuring that the events are recorded, stored, displayed correctly.
